I'm fearful the org.xnap gettext stuff is unmaintained and will disappear, so
I'm committing it here.

http://sf.net/projects/xnap-commons is the project home.

Just type "make" to build and install maven-gettext-plugin and gettext-commons
in your local Maven repository, then you can build Mifos Helper.
